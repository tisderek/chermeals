  description: "Smoked paprika is an essential ingredient in Spanish cuisine: its distinctive flavor and beautiful color bring plenty of vibrant character to numerous dishes. Here, we’re using it in a blend with cumin and turmeric (in a nod to the region's North African influences) to give our hearty chickpea and potato stew warming depth. For a sweet lift, we're also adding in the juice of a pixie mandarin—a late-season citrus variety. Chefs, be sure to stir your garlicky aioli into each bowl of stew for a touch of welcome creaminess.",

#   description: "Tonight, a unique potato salad makes a gourmet side for pan-seared cod. Instead of boiling, we're pan-frying our potatoe for crispy texture, then adding green cabbage and sautéing until wilted. Buttery Castelvetrano olives round out the hearty salad with a touch of briny flavor. For a bright, creamy counterpoint (ideal for drizzling on the cod and vegetables), we're making a sauce with crême fraîche and the juice of a pink lemon, known for its rosy color and slightly fruity tang.",

Ours showcases tender beef sautéed with a blend of za’atar and Aleppo pepper, then layered onto soft pitas along with garlic-seasoned labneh (a rich, creamy cheese made from thick yogurt). A unique salad of arugula and dates balances out the rich sandwiches.',
