This number will rise dramatically over the next 10 years as technology trends like public clouds, enterprise mobility and IoT make our businesses and lives more vulnerable to attackers.\n\nSo who will meet these security demands?\n\nBugcrowd is the premier marketplace for security testing on web, mobile, source code and client-side applications. Taking the leads of Facebook, Paypal and Google's crowdsourced bug bounty programs, we've developed a platform and community that combines a proprietary vulnerability reporting platform with the largest crowd of security researchers on the planet.",
